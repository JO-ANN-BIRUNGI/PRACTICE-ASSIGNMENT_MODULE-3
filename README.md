# PRACTICE-ASSIGNMENT_MODULE-3
Visualizing Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
In this exercise you will cluster credit card customer data using 8 features and visualize those clusters in a two-dimensional scatter plot.

In order to accomplish this, you will:

Import libraries
Load data
Drop unneeded columns
Explore the data and clean as needed
Scale the Data
Tune a KMeans model and cluster the scaled data using all of the features.
Transform the scaled data using PCA
Create a scatter plot of the first 2 principal components of the PCA data, colored by the labels from the KMeans model.
Bonus: Create a 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express scatter_3d() function using the first 3 principal components of the PCA data as the x, y, and z axes and the labels from the KMeans model as the color.
